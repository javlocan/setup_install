# kickstart.nvim
`git clone https://github.com/javlocan/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim`
## My personal config
It might be useful for some other nvim noob

### Organization

I substituted `/custom/plugins` folder with just `/plugins`.
Added `/config` and `/remaps` folders.
Standard config is inside every plugin as `opts = {...}`. I still don't know how to balance this.

### Plugins 

- treesitter-context
- autopairs

### Extra 

- lsp servers installed by Mason
- lsp servers sourced (inside `init.lua`)
- autoformat always enabled
- some keymaps for me

I think that's all folks...
